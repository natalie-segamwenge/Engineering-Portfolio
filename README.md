# Engineering Portfolio – Natalie Segamwenge

Aerospace Engineering (MEng) student with an interest in space systems,
aerodynamics, and simulation-led design.

This repository documents exploratory engineering projects using
industry-relevant tools such as OpenRocket, XFLR5, MATLAB, and Python.
Projects focus on trade studies, modelling assumptions, and engineering
interpretation rather than polished final designs.

## Projects

- **OpenRocket Trade Study**
  Parametric study investigating how fin geometry and mass distribution
  affect stability margin and apogee in a small sounding rocket.
  (Exploratory, January 2026)

More projects will be added as coursework and independent studies progress.
