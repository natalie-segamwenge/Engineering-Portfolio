# OpenRocket Trade Study – Sounding Rocket Stability

## Overview
This project is an exploratory trade study using OpenRocket to investigate
how fin geometry and mass distribution influence the stability margin and
apogee of a small sounding rocket.

**Tool:** OpenRocket  
**Status:** Exploratory  
**Timeframe:** January 2026  

## Engineering Question
How do changes in fin size and centre of gravity position affect rocket
stability and overall flight performance?

## Assumptions
- Rigid body model
- No wind effects
- Fixed motor selection
- Simplified aerodynamic modelling

## Methodology
A baseline rocket configuration was created in OpenRocket. Key parameters
(fin geometry and ballast mass) were varied independently while recording
changes in stability margin and apogee.

## Results
Results will include comparative plots showing the trade-off between
stability margin and performance.

## Limitations & Future Work
This study does not account for wind, manufacturing tolerances, or detailed
CFD validation. Future work could include aerodynamic refinement and
environmental effects.
